////////////////////////////////         step 2
//import the same stuff from react and styled-components as in the last file plus...
// we'll also import {Link} from react-router-dom

// This last one is what we'll use to create our links to our List and Create pages

//We're going to create three styled components here, all divs so we use
// styled.div.attrs and then we'll pass a class to each with no style stuff
// at the end of each...  we did that here but it must be in the
//   main Album___ pages...

//The three styled components we'll create will be called Collapse,
// List and Item
